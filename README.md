===================

Jobs in Product/Dev/SoftwareEngineering

What's Bench? - Check us out in TechCrunch and The New York Times

Want to change something that hasn’t fundamentally changed for centuries? That is exactly what we’re doing! We’re changing the face of bookkeeping one small business owner at a time. This is where you come in. There are a handful of apps that have sought to make the process of doing bookkeeping easier, but they’re all based on the assumption that business owners want to do bookkeeping at all. At Bench, we believe that the best possible solution is to have your bookkeeping done for you by some really cool people who work with game-changing software. Instead of building another tool, we as developers have joined forces with brilliant accountants and augmented their abilities with technology and sweet tech voodoo. As a part of the Bench Dev team, you’ll build everything from delightful client interfaces to complex software tools for our in-house teams. We basically play god, without all the crazy fire and brimstone stuff. Well...maybe.

You’ll fit in great if you:

Write thoughtful, consistent, and readable code

Own > 5 plaid shirts. But would it kill you to try something different?

You don’t just react to problems, you think 2,718,281,828 steps ahead  

Are comfortable with using the right tools for the job, even if it’s new to our stack [insert a ‘You can do it!’ motivational poster here]

Have strong opinions and aren’t afraid to share them (and have them mercilessly crushed ^^)

Can create a webapp from scratch by yourself, from database schema to markup

Your algorithmic mastery goes beyond code and into Settlers of Catan. Or whatever you cool kids play these days.

Here are some of the things you'll be getting up to:

Building scalable and reliable applications and services

Maintaining and refactoring our existing codebase

Collaborating with other departments in prototyping and building new features

Playing fetch with our resident Wheaten Terrier who also loves a good belly rub

Optional / Total Boss Stuff:

Java, Scala, or Clojure experience

You have used functional programming paradigms in projects before

Experience with DevOps tools like Ansible and Docker

Benefits:

A progressive work environment where you're free to manage yourself like a grownup. Our product team regularly cycles between in-office and remote work depending on what kind of projects we're working on.

A workcation policy that lets you work from anywhere in the world.

Benefits to help you keep on top of being a healthy human: great medical and dental coverage, gym membership reimbursements, and transit subsidies.

The usual startup staples: healthy snacks, the best coffee brewed with proper equipment, and beer and wine flowing directly from taps in the wall. IN THE WALL.

The neighbourhood is full of great restaurants and shops and is accessible via plenty of transit options.

Office pets are welcome!

Compensation:

Competitive salary based on experience, with the possibility of stock options for the right candidate.
